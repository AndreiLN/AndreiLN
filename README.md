### 💻 Certified Expert Adobe Commerce Developer / Magento | PHP
Passionate programmer, very good in solving complex issues. I work 5+ years with PHP, focused on E-commerce solutions, since front-end and SEO improvements till the most complex of back-end rules. 

Actually, I'm certified (Professional and Expert) and work with Magento 2 for 4+ years, and already worked with payment gateways (E.g. Itau Pix - Brazilian payment method, this is a private solution) and also with a lot of other things like ERP integrations and some very specific custom modules, always following client requirements.
